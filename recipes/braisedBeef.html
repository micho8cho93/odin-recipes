        <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid. In
            the
            case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is similar to
            stewing, but it requires less liquid.</p>

                <p id="step-text">Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium high and
                    cook, undisturbed
                    until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip
                    pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</p>

                    any
                    browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</p>
